# About Project-X

Welcome to Project-X!

Project-X is an OS-Climate project under the "Data Commons" work
package.  Our objective is to make climate data easier to find, consume
share, and trust.  And to do this we have two key streams of work:
- Climate Data Bazaar, which is a catalog for climate data,
that provides a "marketplace" user interface
- Geospatial Index Server, which provides a uniform grid based upon
Uber's H3 index design and toolkit.

We have a bunch more detail that provides additional context
for our project:
- [Climate Data Challenge](#the-climate-data-challenge)
and illustrate how today climate data is very hard to find, consume,
share, and trust
- [Climate Data Solution](#the-climate-data-solution)
and describes our Ecosystem Platform that makes climate
data easier to find, consume, share, and trust
- [Our Climate Data](#our-climate-data)

## The Climate Data Challenge

Climate data has thousands of sources, myriad formats, huge volumes,
and is constantly changing.  Think of the complexity of a large enterprise's
data landscape and multiply that complexity by several orders of magnitude.
That is climate data.

And while there are some well known sources for climate data, much of the
detailed climate data required to map out climate
trends, or identify and quantify climate risk, is really - really - hard
to find.  Some of it is provided by commercial firms and hence is
behind paywalls and hidden.  Sometimes there are multiple data
sets that address similar data, but they nevertheless vary, making
it hard to determine which data to actually trust.  Sometimes the
data requires such intensive processing that it may as well not
be practical for many firms to use.  And sometimes the data you
need just does not exist, but rather must be combined from several
sources using complex algorithms, forcing
organizations to learn new techiques or understand many levels of software
before being able to consume the data they need.

Simply put, climate data is hard to find, consume, share, and trust.

Now, combine this with the increasingly active regulatory environment
faces by most organizations today, where firms need to mobilize quickly
but find the climate data ground they need is unstable or inaccessible.
It is increasingly costly, inefficient, and impractical – in the
face of increasing need and regulation – to acquire, access, and use
climate data required to address climate change in any timely and
meaningful way.

## The Climate Data Solution

Our objective is to address this challenge.  We have
developed and Ecosystem Platform that makes
climate data easy to find, consume, share, and trust.  And we
think an open source approach is best, fastest, and most
transparent and trustworthy way to do this.

Our goal is to provide the open source software for
the Ecosystem Platform and allow you to create, run,
and extend the platform to suit your needs.

## Our Climate Data

The Ecosystem Platform can support a very broad data landscape, much
of which has a location aspect, including:
- Climate data, including precipitation, temperature, flood, drought,
sea-level data and much more
- Asset data, including public (bridges) and private assets (commercial
property)
- Demographic data, for population centers, country and regional jurisdictions
and locales
- Biodiversity data, including forestry, agriculture, animals, and species

The location-based data will not only be available in the Climate
Data Bazaar, but also in the Geospatial indix services.

But we also store non-location based data also - in fact any type
of data can conceivably be made available in the Climate Data Bazaar.
- PCAF data, that analyzes sovereign debt exposure to climate change
- Calculation engines, notebooks, and other software (via references to
GitHub repositories)
- Models, that calculate hazard, exposure, and vulnerabilities
to support Physical Risk analysis (via references to model
inventories and libraries)
