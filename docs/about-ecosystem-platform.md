# About Ecosystem Platforms

What is an Ecosystem Platform? I guess the simple answer is that
an Ecosystem Platform helps consumers and providers find each other,
interact, and even transact.

## The Ecosystems PlatformsHidden in Plain Sight

Ecosystem Platforms are kind of like
what AirBnB has created. AirBnb, as an ecosystem platform, helps
people (providers) who have properties rent them to people (consumers)
that want to rent those properties. Uber is also an ecosystem platform.
It makes it easy for people who need a ride (consumers) find people
(providers) that have cars that can provide rides. Both AirBnB and Uber
make it easy for their consumers and providers to find each other,
interact, and transact.

## The Ecosystems Platform Definition

What is an ecosystem platform? An ecosystem platform
has several actors and components:
- Consumers, that, well, consume, things or services
- Providers, that create or publish things or services
- Andâ€¦ the Ecosystem Platform.:

Today, most developers build applications.  But almost all have
consumers that use the applcation, and they have providers that
create data or services for the application, and the application
may be considered a "platform".

But what distinguishes an Ecosystem Platform from
applications that most firms build today?  Well, it is the
standardization of the consumer and provider experience into
a set of core capabilities that we call the Ecosystem Platform.

## The Ecosystems Platform Capabilities

Core Ecosystem Platform capabilities include:
- Consistent on-boarding for consumers and providers, that make
it easy to participate in the ecosystem
- Safe and secure identity verification for consumers and
providers that provide a turstworthy environment
- A "marketplace" where consumers can find providers and interact
(and even transact) with them
- A dashboard where consumers and providers can manage their experience
- Integrated subscriptions and payments, to allow consumers to use
existing business relationships to facilitate transactions

So, simply put, Ecosystem platforms address both the consumer
and publisher experience. They have the tools, systems, and user
interfaces that make it easy for consumers and providers to find
each other, interact, and transact.
